 <p>Welcome to the push messaging codelab. The button below needs to be
    fixed to support subscribing to push.</p>
    <p>
      <button disabled class="js-push-btn mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--raised mdl-js-ripple-effect">
        Enable Push Messaging
      </button>
       <button ng-click="sendNotification()" class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--raised mdl-js-ripple-effect">
        Send Push notification
      </button>
    </p>
    <section class="subscription-details js-subscription-details is-invisible">
      <p>Once you've subscribed your user, you'd send their subscription to your
      server to store in a database so that when you want to send a message
      you can lookup the subscription and send a message to it.</p>
      <p>To simplify things for this code lab copy the following details
      into the <a href="https://web-push-codelab.appspot.com/">Push Companion
      Site</a> and it'll send a push message for you, using the application
      server keys on the site - so make sure they match.</p>
